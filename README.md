Completed by Hudson, Jack, Jayden and, Vim in Semester 1 2022.

The project operates through a Java based GUI to create and allow the storage and exportation of mazes for uses such as the back of cereal bowls.

## Making code changes
  Any major changes to the code should be done on your own branch first. To do this make sure you checkout your local code to your branch and not have it be on master/main.![Screenshot (2)_LI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102127250/164956976-196a01b7-f0fe-4f48-9358-d44d9c94031e.jpg)

## Link your code to an Issue
  Almost all code you want to commit will be to address a specific issue in the github page (If not then you should probably create an issue so read on further to find     how to do that)

  To do this simply add '#<insert-issue-number>' to your commit comment and it will automatically link to the issue.

## Creating an Issue
  If you feel an issue needs to be created or want to add commit some code but do not think there is a suitable issue to link it to, then you probably want to create a     new issue. To do this go to the issues page and go 'New issue'

  Give it a nice title and a brief summary and possibly link it to any other issues you can think of (optional)

  After this you want to move over to the right hand column of things and assign it appropriately.

  Here I have assigned it to myself because I will be working on it. It is okay to not assign it to yourself only if it is part of a planned section that you are not currently working on but don't want to forget to not add the issue.
  
  For labels I would say do as many as you think are applicable but it MUST have a priority (Low, Medium, or High)
  
  For projects I assigned it the GUI product as it is not documentation nor a general coding project and thus would probably clutter those project issues on the scrum board. 
  
  Finally, for milestone I selected the prototype(code) as it is coding related to the prototype release. For future milestones we will probably split up each component into its own milestone for tracibility.
  
  Now that I am happy and assigned everything I click 'submit new issue'.

  Once done I go to Projects and GUI so I can assign it to being in the 'In Progress' column as I actually am working on it. If I am currently doing something else and won't get around to doing that issue in a while, it is probably better to leave it in the backlog.
